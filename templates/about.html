          My name is Havee Makedon—a lifelong learner, educator, and creator with a passion for technology, philosophy, and impactful storytelling. Whether I’m teaching in the classroom, building digital projects, or diving deep into historical texts, I bring curiosity, structure, and purpose to everything I do.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background that blends computer science education, business strategy, and philosophical inquiry, I’ve developed a unique ability to connect ideas across disciplines. My goal is to use that skillset to inspire others, build smarter systems, and make learning a transformative experience.

          When I’m not working with students or developing new tools, you can find me studying ancient thinkers, lifting weights, writing code, or exploring ways to make communities stronger through innovation and education. Welcome to my site—and thanks for stopping by.
